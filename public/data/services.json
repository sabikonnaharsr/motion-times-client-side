This is a very common request, and we absolutely LOVE to help!  Our Grand Canyon Proposal Package is designed to be a Sunset Picnic excursion; that’s the cover story anyways!  We set up a special picnic for you and your sweetheart, then greet you upon arrival to escort you to the location.  Your sweetie will just think you arranged a sunset viewing picnic for two.  In reality, you are about to propose, and we are secretly snapping photos of the whole thing from afar!   Once you pop the question, the photographer will come over, introduce themselves and take some lovely engagement photos with the Grand Canyon in the background.  Afterwards, you are free to enjoy your time with your fiancé, and we will take care of the picnic cleanup."

Marriage licenses have been delegated by The Superior Court of the State of Arizona, to be issued by each and every county. A wedding license issued by any AZ County is valid as a license for marriage in any AZ County (for instance, you can use a Maricopa County Marriage License in Pima County, etc.). Once purchased, the marriage license must be used within one year."
