        AN AFFAIR BY THE LAKE Geoff was laid back,</span> listened to what we wanted, and took great photos in a very short amount of time. Our wedding was 4 hours from start to finish and Geoff was there for 3, which is not that long for all of those photos. He even stayed a few minutes longer to capture a few more photos for us. It was much appreciated! Thanks Portrait Gallery! Our pictures came out great!
